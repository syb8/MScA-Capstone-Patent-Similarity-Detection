# Patent Similarity Detection for Raytheon Technologies

## Introduction
We propose a framework to optimize the prior art search, a critical initial step in the patent application process. If Raytheon Technologies uses our patent similarity search system powered by natural language processing, they can reduce operational costs and time involved in patent application and perform efficient due diligence with researching previously approved patents (prior art search).
